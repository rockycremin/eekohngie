So, as someone who is of African descent, I could go on forever about the stereotypes and assumptions people make about me. But this isn't about me. I'd like people who aren't of Asian descent to share the ignorant stereotypes and myths you believed about Asians and gay Asian men or women that were debunked when you were around actual Asians.

This post is a response to this (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/an2n9x/when_will_darkskinned_indian_women_ever_play_the/) post made by u/KLBikey earlier today. They said that dark skinned Tamilian women don't get roles in Bollywood etc. Instead light skinned North Indians get them. My point is that skin color matters but that isn't the core reason why dark skinned Dravidian women don't get many roles in Bollywood or other movies. The deeper problem is the phenotype. Do you think. Textures have once again reminded us why they are revered and respected by many as trailblazers of the modern progressive metal scene.

So any help as to why and how to fix it would. To start off, I’m simply going to introduce the band that really needs no introduction, Meshuggah. Meshuggah was formed (under that title) in 1988, bringing a new approach to thrash metal and math rock to the table with a heavy emphasis on chugging, oddly timed riffs and polymetric compositions. Their debut, Contradictions Collapse, wasn’t necessarily the exact moment that this style truly took shape, as it still was more easily described as thrash than any form of progressive metal Textures — металлический секстет из Голландии, чьи авангардные музыкальные произведения совмещают в себе брутальность death metal и экспериментальность  Phenotype (2016).

I used to have the fullest head of hair (so much so that the hairdresser would thin it out regularly), but a couple months before my 18th birthday I started losing hair like crazy. Handfuls of hair would be on my hands when I would lather in the shower. I would see it all over my pillow, and sometimes see it falling from my head into my food.
